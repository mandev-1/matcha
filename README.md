## Chapter II
### Introduction
This project aims to create a dating website.
You need to develop an application that facilitates connections
between two potential partners, covering the entire process from
registration to the final meeting.
Users should be able to register, log in, complete their profile, search for and view other
users' profiles, and express interest in them with a "like"1
. They should also be able to
chat with those who have reciprocated their interest.
